POST	projects/{project_id}/folders/{folder_id}/permissions:batch-delete
Deletes all the permissions assigned to specified users, roles, and companies. To remove some of the permissions assigned to users, roles, and companies, use the Update permissions endpoint.

Note that you cannot delete permission for project admins, who are always assigned full permissions.

For more information about folder permissions, see the BIM 360 Help documentation or the ACC Files Help documentation.

In addition to the permissions that were assigned to the user for this folder, the user also inherits permissions from any parent folder. After deleting permissions for the folder, the user will still continue to have permissions that were inherited from any parent folder. In order to completely delete the user’s permissions, you need to also delete the user’s permissions from all parent folders.

Note that in addition to inherited permissions, the user might also have been assigned permissions for the folder if a company or roles were assigned to both the user and the folder. To check which company and roles were assigned to the user, call GET /users/user_id. To check which roles and companies were assigned to the folder, call GET permissions. To remove the copmpany or roles permissions for the user from the folder, either remove the company or roles from the folder by calling this endpoint, or remove the company or roles from the user using PATCH /users/user_id.

If you are calling this endpoint on behalf of a user, the user needs to have CONTROL permissions for the folder.

Note that this endpoint is compatible with both BIM 360 and Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) projects.
