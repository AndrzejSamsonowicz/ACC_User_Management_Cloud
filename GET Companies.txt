Authorization*
string
Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is obtained via either a two-legged or three-legged OAuth flow.
Region

Specifies the region where your request should be routed. If not set, the request is routed automatically, which may result in a slight increase in latency.

User-Id
string
The ID of a user on whose behalf your request is acting.
Your app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. Provide this header value to identify the user to be affected by the request.

You can use either the user’s ACC ID (id), or their Autodesk ID (autodeskId).

Note that this header is required for Account Admin POST, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints if you want to use a 2-legged authentication context. This header is optional for Account Admin GET endpoints.
