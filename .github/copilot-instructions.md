# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working in this codebase.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project in the early stages of development. The project structure and patterns will evolve as the codebase grows. This document should be updated as architectural decisions and conventions are established.

## Current Status

- Project is in initial setup phase
- No established patterns or conventions yet
- Core architecture decisions pending

## Next Steps for AI Assistance

1. Help establish and document:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Development workflows
   - Coding standards and patterns
   - Testing approach
   - Deployment processes

2. When implementing new features:
   - Propose clean, maintainable architectures
   - Document key decisions in code comments
   - Create or update relevant documentation

3. Watch for emerging patterns and conventions to document here

## Future Sections to Add

As the project develops, this document should be expanded to include:

- Architecture overview and component relationships
- Development environment setup
- Build and test workflows
- Project-specific patterns and best practices
- Integration points and external dependencies
- Troubleshooting guides

This is a living document - please help keep it updated as the project evolves.
